# Performance and Scalability Considerations
## Time Complexity

#### Search Operation
The Red-Black tree operations are O(log n) because at each level, we eliminate half of the remaining nodes which is where the log n comes from and there is only one comparison done each step making it constant time. This means the time complexity is O(1) work and O(log n) levels resulting in a total O(log n).

#### Insert Operation
Takes O(log n) time
Includes the time needed to keep the tree balanced and maintains good performance even when adding many products

## Large Dataset Performance
Implementation testing with a large Amazon product dataset:
- Successfully handled thousands of products
- Maintained quick search and insert times
- Memory usage scaled well with data size

## Tree Balancing
The Red-Black tree automatically stays balanced by:
- Adjusting node colors
- Rotating nodes when needed
- Ensuring no path is more than twice as long as another

This balancing is important because it:
- Prevents the tree from becoming uneven
- Makes sure searches stay efficient

Our testing showed the implementation successfully maintains O(log n) performance for all operations, making it suitable.
