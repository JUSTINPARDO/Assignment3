# Performance and Scalability Considerations
## Time Complexity

#### Search Operation
The Red-Black tree operations are O(log n) because at each level, we eliminate half of the remaining nodes which is where the log n comes from and there is only one comparison done each step making it constant time. This means the time complexity is O(1) work and O(log n) levels resulting in a total O(log n).

#### Insert Operation
The insert operation in the Red-Black tree is O(log n) because it requires two main steps. First, we must find the insertion location which, like search, takes O(log n) as we eliminate half the nodes at each level with O(1) comparisons. After inserting, we may need to rebalance the tree through color changes and rotations, but these are constant time operations (O(1)) and can only occur up the path to the root (O(log n) levels). This means the total complexity is still O(log n) as both finding the position and rebalancing operate on O(log n) levels with O(1) work at each level.

## Large Dataset Performance
Implementation testing with a large Amazon product dataset:
- Successfully handled thousands of products
- Maintained quick search and insert times
- Memory usage scaled well with data size

## Tree Balancing
The Red-Black tree automatically stays balanced by:
- Adjusting node colors
- Rotating nodes when needed
- Ensuring no path is more than twice as long as another

This balancing is important because it:
- Prevents the tree from becoming uneven
- Makes sure searches stay efficient

Our testing showed the implementation successfully maintains O(log n) performance for all operations, making it suitable.
